# basicVBM
These scripts may help you perform some basic voxel based morphometry with correlation, partial correlation, distance correlation, partial distance correlation or mediation analysis. They also support correction for cluster size with permutations. See demo.m for examples. Analysis with ROI-level data is possible but not demonstrated in the demo.

See medVoxFast.m for code that combines all steps in the pipeline in demo.m and is a bit more efficient and faster (and introduces a few additional options). Despite the name, this will also let you do correlation-based analyses.
