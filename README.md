# basicVBM
These scripts may help you perform some basic voxel based morphometry with correlation, partial correlation, distance correlation, partial distance correlation or mediation analysis. They also support correction for cluster size with permutations. See demo.m for examples. Analysis with ROI-level data is possible but not demonstrated in the demo.
